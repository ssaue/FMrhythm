# FMrhythm
Rhythm synthesis with FM modulation

This is an application for doing rhythm synthesis with frequency modulated timing. 
Typical application areas are Norwegian folk music with irregular meter, the classic Vienna waltz and jazz swing.

The application currently builds with MS Visual C++ 2017. 
We intend to port the application to a platform independent framework (such as Juce).

The project and solution files are found under \build\<target platform>.
